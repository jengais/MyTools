He believes Fenrir and Fenris arose under the influence of Christian conceptions of the devil as lupus infernus , combined with tales of the Behemoth and the beast of the Apocalypse , and was altered in form in accordance with popular Old Norse etymology . He compares Old Norse fern from Latin infernus to Old Saxon fern which was derived from Latin infernum , and explains that Fenrir and Fenris must have been formed from *Fernir from fern using the endings -ir and gen. -is , both of which were very much used in mythical names , including names of giants .
